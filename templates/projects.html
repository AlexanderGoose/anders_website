            My initial interest in orbits evolved from my interest in studying higher dimensions. 
            This interest led me to a forum on higher dimensions which discussed orbits in higher
            dimensional orbits. For example, gravity drops off with \( \frac{1}{r^{(dimensions-1)}} \), so with higher
            dimensions gravity weakens more rapidly over distances. This situation creates unstable 
            orbits in 4 dimensions or more. I discovered that orbits can be stable in 4-dimensions only 
            if the orbit is a perfect circle. Any other orbit will spiral in or spiral out.

            As I explored this more I found a site that would help me with modeling the inverse force 
            law \( \frac{1}{r^x} \) , with any value of \( x \). I discovered that I could create more interesting force laws that
            use \( \cos ùë• \), \( sin ùë• \), and \( e^x \), some of which create flower or star-shaped orbits. Also, I could 
            change the mass of the orbiting object and central object resulting in some interesting orbits, 
            such as the orbit of Pluto and Charon in our solar system.

            I wanted to explore some additional functions that I could not incorporate into the website 
            program, so I developed my own program which ran on Excel. This took some time and much work; 
            however, I finally perfected it. This allowed me to utilize a Bessely function to devise a 
            stable orbit in a 4-dimensional system. Also, I varied the mass of the two objects to see how 
            that would impact the orbit.

            The Chair of the Math & Physics Department at Queens University of Charlotte, Michael Tarabek, 
            Ph.D., encouraged me to utilize my interest in orbits for my senior capstone project. I still 
            enjoy working on modeling orbits. I am also currently working on learning about modeling geodesics 
            on a curved surface. See the link to view my capstone project.
